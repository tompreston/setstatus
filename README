      Title: setstatus
     Author: Thomas Preston
Description: Sets the root window name to the currently playing
             track, the amount of battery left and the time.
             It's pretty much a rewrite of dwmstatus on the
             suckless website. I wanted to do it my way. :-)
    Install: To build, just type 'make setstatus'
